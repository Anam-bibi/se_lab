<h3><center>Secnario of Courier Management</center></h3>
<p>The courier management system is a software application designed to streamline the courier delivery process. The system includes various modules to manage the pickup, delivery, and tracking of packages.
</p>
<p>When a customer places an order for a courier pickup, the system assigns a courier driver to pick up the package from the customer's location. The driver is notified of the pickup request through a mobile app or web interface.
</p>
<p>The driver then picks up the package from the customer and scans it into the system using a barcode scanner. The system updates the status of the package as "in transit" and sends a notification to the customer with the expected delivery time</p>.

<p>The driver then delivers the package to the destination address and scans it again to update the system's status as "delivered". The system sends a notification to the customer with the delivery confirmation.</p>
<p>If the package cannot be delivered for any reason, the driver can update the status of the package as "rerouted" in the system. The system then assigns a new delivery address and notifies the customer of the new delivery time.</p>
<p>The system also provides various reports and analytics to help manage the courier delivery process. Dispatchers can view real-time information about the location and status of all packages and drivers.</p>
<p>The system is designed to be user-friendly and accessible through both web and mobile interfaces. It also includes various security measures, such as user authentication and encryption, to ensure the privacy and security of package information.
